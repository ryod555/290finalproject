# Action Plan

Action Plan (25%)

The last major deliverable for the final project is the creation of a 6 month action plan for your project! This plan should be realistic to help you reach your goals of completing this project. You do not need to factor in completing the entire project within the next 6 months, but should outline a meaningful amount of progress. The goal is to create a real action plan that you will be able to follow as you enter Winter Break and next semester, enabling you to gain experience and build up your skills! Your action plan should include:

Monthly Schedule: For each three week period after finals, please include the following:
Goal: What would you like to accomplish in this three week period? This can either be learning a new skill or working on your project. Include three bullet points in this section, each should be ~2-3 sentences.
Tasks: Write a checklist of tasks to complete. When you are following this plan, you should use these tasks to drive your progress and stay focused! To accomplish this, your tasks should be clear, granular, and not overloaded. Try to include ~4 tasks in this section, adjusting more or less as needed based on the goal for this three week period. Note, if you are consistently including only 1-2 tasks per period, you are likely not being clear and granular enough.
Extra Resources: Try to include 1-2 extra resources in this section that can help you complete your task. You may just paste a link for each here.

In total, your plan should contain 6 sections, each with the Goal (3 bullet points each), Tasks, and Extra Resources sections completed.


Immersive and abstract visuals for a song. 

Week 1 
  Goal: Learn how to incorporate BPM into code. 
  Tasks: 
  - Learn time variables in C#.
  - Test this by outputting a simple console message each incr.
  - Learn how to calculate BPM into a unit of time that can be used to create time based functions in C#.

Week 2: 
  Goal: Learn to apply this to an object, perhaps by toggling a simple setting to each beat. 
  Tasks: 
  - Learn time based functions, which trigger every specified ms.
  - Learn how to use these time based functions to toggle a property on or off, or between two static arbituary values.
  - Try changing the color of a sphere from red to blue on bpm.
  - Test on different increments of time, such as every eighth note.

Week 3: 
  Goal: Apply this to a more complicated property, such as changing the positioning of just a single vector, or size of a face of an object.
  Tasks: 
  - Learn how to use on a more complicated properties, such as transitioning between a sphere's size.
  - Try transitioning a spheres size from small to big and big to small
  - Test on different increments of time.

Week 4: 
  Goal: Apply this to a larger more complex object, also making the transitions more complex, possibly like using ease. 
  Tasks: 
  - Learn how to apply this on a larger more complicated object, such a model
  - Learn syncing multiple smaller objects at once.
  - Learn how to make the transitions smoother if necessary through formulas.

Week 5: 
  Goal: Build a still scene. 
  Tasks: 
  - Look for free assets
  - or practice making my own, probably much simpler models
  - Take inspiration from still peices of art, maybe renaissance
  - Learn lighting properties in C#.
  - Get more familiar with 3D properties
  - Construct a scene with 3D objects reflecting my musical persona and theme.
  - I could go on about this but for some simple theme words: Heavenly, Purgatory, Sky

Week 6:  
  Goal: Apply animations to objects of the scene, rendering it. 
  Tasks: 
  - Assemble everything together, using the code to animate objects in the scene.
  - Sync up audio in a video editor
