# Action Plan

Action Plan (25%)

The last major deliverable for the final project is the creation of a 6 month action plan for your project! This plan should be realistic to help you reach your goals of completing this project. You do not need to factor in completing the entire project within the next 6 months, but should outline a meaningful amount of progress. The goal is to create a real action plan that you will be able to follow as you enter Winter Break and next semester, enabling you to gain experience and build up your skills! Your action plan should include:

Monthly Schedule: For each three week period after finals, please include the following:
Goal: What would you like to accomplish in this three week period? This can either be learning a new skill or working on your project. Include three bullet points in this section, each should be ~2-3 sentences.
Tasks: Write a checklist of tasks to complete. When you are following this plan, you should use these tasks to drive your progress and stay focused! To accomplish this, your tasks should be clear, granular, and not overloaded. Try to include ~4 tasks in this section, adjusting more or less as needed based on the goal for this three week period. Note, if you are consistently including only 1-2 tasks per period, you are likely not being clear and granular enough.
Extra Resources: Try to include 1-2 extra resources in this section that can help you complete your task. You may just paste a link for each here.

In total, your plan should contain 6 sections, each with the Goal (3 bullet points each), Tasks, and Extra Resources sections completed.
